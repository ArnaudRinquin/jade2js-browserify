jade2js-browserify
==================

for turning crummy Jade into beautiful Javascript strings, with browserify

This package is just a wrapper on top of a custom version of
[`html2js-browserify`](https://github.com/ArnaudRinquin/html2js-browserify) by
[featurist](https://github.com/featurist)
(pull request pending).
